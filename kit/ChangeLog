Version 1.3 (2012-04-26):

- Created a new app "Debian Kit" and placed it on Google play. The
  app checks for showstoppers and informs about updates. May get
  more features if I find the time (e.g. Install, Start-Stop-X).
- Created a new project on sourceforge named "Debian Kit"
- Bugfix for HTC desire: this devices offers very low space
  in /data/app, which causes uses to extensively use app-to-sd.
  Since every to-sd'd app eats up a loop devices, we simply
  need much more device nodes below /dev.

Version 1.2 (2012-04-12):

- Changed from using symlinks to 'mount --bind', e.g. to run Virtualbox>4.0 that
  does not like /usr as a symlink. Also fixess quirks with bash tab-completion
- Changed /data/local/bin -> /data/local/deb because some people already use
  this directory for other stuff (e.g. other busybox/openvpn binaries)
- Added i386 architecture to ./i386, moved arm binaries to ./armel
  Note: if you use my old /data/local/bin/openvpn, you need to
  change binary and kernel module pathes to /data/local/deb/armel.
- New device: HTC Desire with Cyanogenmod (successful test)
- New device: Samsung Nexus w/ ICS (fail, some funny deb* not found msg)
- Removed "ff" script (Note: You can use arm/wpa_supplicant for AdHoc, works for me)
- Added md5sum checksums at the end of the self-extracting shell archive
- Added cleanup script to remove binaries that are not required to run Debian
- Added "(u)pdate 'deb' symlink" option to mk-debian if image file exists
- Removed dependency to external 'id' program, changed already-mounted detection
- Changed '/system/bin/deb' link to small script file with same function
- Switched from Debian's debootstrap to Ubuntu's, has e.g. sha1sum & precise
- Reworked sources.list for Debian/Sqeeze, Ubuntu/Lucid, and Ubuntu/Precise
- Added autorun script to the shell archive for convenience in default case
- Updated androresolvd*.deb to work with resolvconf (default with Ubuntu/Precise)
- Updated andromize*.deb to adapt upstart (start|stop) for chrooted environments
  dpkg-divert --local --rename --add /sbin/initctl;ln -s /bin/true /sbin/initctl
- Adapted uclibc propget-addon to android-x86.org which uses PROP_NAME_MAX 128
- Adapted creation of /system/bin/ash link because on ICS emulator this is an executeable
- Save IMG= and MNT= from existing bootdeb to make updates easier (simply unpack & go)
- Added LD_LIBRARY_PATH= to bootdeb, prevents custom ROMs from interfering with libs
- Added warning if gid!=0, in which case bash does not act as login shell (short prompt)
- The bootdeb script is filenames-with-space agnostic now, also accepts IMG=/dev/xxx
- Added IMG=/dev/xxx (block device) query to mk-debian as well as fdisk to busybox
- Added "bootdeb c" switch to remove link that point to Android root necessary e.g.
  if you flash another custom Android ROM but you want to use the old debian.img
- Change "mk-debian" for getopts. See "mk-debian -h" for details.
- Added new "andromize-lxde" package to conveniently install LXDE on xrdp.
- Added ability to work with devices (also remembers UUID in bootdeb). Use
  "mk-debian -i /dev/bla" to create, use "fdisk" to change partitions if needed.
- Added minimal "initctl" script to start/stop upstart jobs (e.g. xrdp, ssh)
- Bugfix busybox-installer.apk's ash: echo "\0" - octal num interprets 0x10-0x17 chars.
- Moved "mk-debian -U" to extra "uninstall" script not removed by "clean".
- Removed Debian-Lenny, because files are removed from Debian servers
- Changed /etc/init.d/androresolvd to SIG_INT, because on Archos HT7c SIG_TERM
  is blocked during nanosleep(), a non-standard I found no good explanation for.
- Added iptables rules for localhost/tcp/3389 for "deb x" (relaxes CyanogenMod 9 FW)
- Merge in /system/lib/modules directory in case *.ko file are placed there.

- Todo: Testing, testing, testing [...]
